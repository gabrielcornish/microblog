<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Have you ever tried to make a game about a theme like love?</p>

<p>It sounds simple, right?</p>

<p>But when you sit down to design it, you might find yourself stuck.</p>

<p>Where do you even start? There are so many ways to approach this theme. It&rsquo;s like standing at a crossroads with hundreds of paths.</p>

<p>You could go in any direction, but how do you know which one is right?</p>

<p>This is a big challenge for game designers, both newbies and pros. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the sea of ideas and end up not starting at all.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>

<p>Why is solving this problem important?</p>

<p>Well, having a clear process to turn any theme into a game concept is key. It helps you move faster in developing your game.</p>

<p>You waste less time thinking and more time actually creating. Plus, you start to get a feel for what ideas will work and what won&rsquo;t right from the start.</p>

<h2 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been there, stuck in the idea phase.</p>

<p>Once, during a game jam, I spent half of the 48 hours trying to decide on an idea.</p>

<p>When I finally picked one, I hardly had any time left to make the game. And I wasn&rsquo;t alone in this struggle. After reading other developers&rsquo; logs, I knew we needed a better way.</p>

<h2 id="verb-before-consequence">Verb Before Consequence</h2>

<p><strong>The solution is simple</strong>: &ldquo;Verb Before Consequence&rdquo;, or V.B.C.</p>

<p>This means you think of a gameplay idea as something the player must do (the verb) before something else happens (the consequence).</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Rescue the princess BEFORE the dragon eats her.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Stop the love of your life at the airport BEFORE they hop on a plane and leave forever.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Clean the whole house BEFORE your parents get home.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These ideas have a few key things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Drama</strong>: There&rsquo;s a clear consequence and a ticking clock.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Interactivity</strong>: The player has a task they must do.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: You understand what the game is about.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="objections">Objections</h2>

<p>Some might say this method is too simple to create a good game. But simplicity is powerful. The best games often have straightforward, engaging concepts.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Chess</strong>: Checkmate your opponent BEFORE they checkmate you</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong>: &ldquo;Reach the end of the level BEFORE time runs out</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Capture The Flag</strong>: Take the other team&rsquo;s flag back to your base BEFORE they take yours</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Basketball / Football / Soccer</strong>: Score the most amount of points BEFORE time runs out</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can dissect plenty of games and mechanics using this lens.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-v-b-c-technique">How to use the V.B.C. Technique</h2>

<p>Whenever you need to come up with a gameplay concept, fill in the blanks, <strong>&ldquo;Do (Verb) BEFORE (Consequence).&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Boom! You&rsquo;ve got a solid concept to start designing your game.</p>

<p>By using this V.B.C. method, you&rsquo;ll find yourself moving from idea to game development much faster.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a straightforward, effective tool to unlock endless creative possibilities.</p>

<p>So, next time you&rsquo;re stuck, remember: <strong>Verb Before Consequence</strong>.</p>

<p>Happy game designing!</p>

		<a href="https://gabrielcornish.com/2024/01/15/ask-this-one.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-15 10:24:30 -0800">Jan 15, 2024</time></a>

<p>You know how tricky and complex game design can be.</p>

<p>In this journey filled with endless tasks and challenges, it&rsquo;s easy to lose focus. But there&rsquo;s one simple question that can make your life as a game designer much easier.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-big-question">What&rsquo;s the Big Question?</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the most important question you should always ask:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What problem are we trying to solve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s often overlooked even with experienced developers. When you&rsquo;re deep in game development, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the details and forget the main goal.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein said, “If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.”</p>

<p>This quote highlights how crucial it is to know the problem before you jump into solutions.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-question-matters">Why This Question Matters</h2>

<p>Game development is a journey filled with distractions.</p>

<p>As a game designer, your job is to solve problems for the player. But remember, not every problem needs solving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to focus on the right ones. Asking &ldquo;What problem are we solving?&rdquo; brings clarity and focus.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-asking-the-right-question">The Benefits of Asking the Right Question</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Productivity: If you understand the problem, you can work more efficiently.</p></li>

<li><p>Alignment: It ensures everyone on the team is on the same page. This minimizes miscommunication and conflicts.</p></li>

<li><p>Time-saving: It saves hours of work. You don&rsquo;t waste time on solving the wrong problems.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-people-avoid-asking-this-question">Why People Avoid Asking This Question</h2>

<p>Some might think it&rsquo;s a rude question, or fear it might get annoying if asked too often.</p>

<p>But the truth is, it&rsquo;s a necessary step in effective problem-solving.</p>

<h2 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in design meetings where we debated solutions for hours! It never occurred to us that we didn&rsquo;t even agree on the problem.</p>

<p>We spent hours in discussions and left with no clear direction. We could have avoided this by asking, &ldquo;What problem are we solving?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-framework">A Simple Framework</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Agree on the Problem: Always ensure everyone agrees on the problem.</p></li>

<li><p>Clear Goal: At the start of meetings, state the problem you&rsquo;re there to solve.</p></li>

<li><p>Self-Reflection:  If you&rsquo;re on your own, ask yourself if you&rsquo;re solving the right problem. Is it a problem worth solving to begin with?</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In game development, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in endless tasks.</p>

<p>By asking, &ldquo;What problem are we solving?&rdquo; you bring clarity and focus to your work.</p>

<p>This simple question is a powerful tool in your game design toolkit. Use it wisely, and watch your productivity and efficiency soar!</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-big-deal-with-feedback">What&rsquo;s the Big Deal with Feedback?</h2>

<p>When you&rsquo;re crafting a video game, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in a bubble.</p>

<p>You think your game is awesome, but will others feel the same?</p>

<p>The truth is, you can&rsquo;t know if your game is a hit or a miss until players get their hands on it. That&rsquo;s where feedback comes in, and trust me on this, it&rsquo;s a game-changer!</p>

<h2 id="why-feedback-is-your-superpower">Why Feedback is Your Superpower</h2>

<p>Imagine feedback as a power tool in your game design toolbox. It&rsquo;s not just about listening to what others say about your game. It&rsquo;s about how you listen.</p>

<p>Taking feedback the right way can turn your good game into a legendary one. It will also improve your relationship with players and coworkers!</p>

<h2 id="ego-be-gone">Ego, Be Gone!</h2>

<p>First things first, you&rsquo;ve got to ditch the ego. I&rsquo;m serious.</p>

<p>Remember, your game isn&rsquo;t about you – it&rsquo;s for the players. When someone gives you feedback, they&rsquo;re helping you, not attacking you.</p>

<p>Appreciation is key here.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with what they&rsquo;re saying, say thanks. It shows you value their opinion. They will be more likely to come to you again with feedback.</p>

<h2 id="the-truth-about-feedback">The Truth About Feedback</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a secret: when someone tells you there&rsquo;s a problem with your game, they&rsquo;re usually right.</p>

<p>But if they give you a solution, be cautious. That&rsquo;s your job to figure out.</p>

<p>Either way, be grateful you&rsquo;re getting feedback. If someone&rsquo;s not giving you feedback after you ask, it might mean they don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll receive it well. Yikes!</p>

<p>You want play testers to always feel comfortable being honest with you. That&rsquo;s your responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="why-feedback-rocks">Why Feedback Rocks</h2>

<p>Learning to love feedback can do wonders.</p>

<p>The more feedback you get, the more you learn, and the better your game becomes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like having a secret weapon that keeps making your game cooler and cooler.  Designers who know how to receive feedback will always produce a better game than those who don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2 id="common-worries-about-feedback">Common Worries About Feedback</h2>

<p>Some people worry that showing their game too early might give a bad impression. Or worse, someone might steal their idea!</p>

<p>And sometimes, the feedback feels just&hellip; wrong. Like the player doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;get&rsquo; your game. Or they&rsquo;ll just tell you what you already know.</p>

<p>These are real worries, but don&rsquo;t let them stop you from seeking it out anyway. The value you get from a good feedback process outweighs any of the costs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too early to get feedback.</p>

<p>Look at how Slay the Spire looked when their designers started requesting feedback.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2024/slay.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt=""></p>

<p>That game went on to become a smash hit!</p>

<h2 id="my-story-with-feedback">My Story with Feedback</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t always take feedback well.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I would get defensive or justify my design. I would blame the person for not &ldquo;getting&rdquo; my design.</p>

<p>This held me back as a game designer.</p>

<p>But when I started embracing feedback, everything changed. I went from a so-so designer to one of the best on my team! I got promotions and more opportunities within the studio.</p>

<p>People enjoyed working with me because I was open to their ideas. They felt comfortable coming to me with problems and I loved hearing their feedback.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always easy, but it was always worth it.</p>

<h2 id="feedback-made-easy-a-two-step-process">Feedback Made Easy: A Two-Step Process</h2>

<p>Ready to become a feedback expert? Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Appreciate the Feedback</strong>: Say thanks, even if you don&rsquo;t agree. It shows gratitude and encourages the other person to come back with more.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Accept or Discard</strong>: You decide if the feedback works for your game. Give the feedback honest consideration before making a decision. (Pssst, you can keep this part a secret.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Feedback isn&rsquo;t just about making your game better. It&rsquo;s about being a better designer, a better team player, and building trust with players.</p>

<p>When someone offers you feedback, remember, it&rsquo;s not just advice.  It&rsquo;s your ticket to being a great game designer! 🌟🎮👾</p>

<p>I owe my entire game development career to a single practice: <strong>Learning to make games in 2 hours</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re all busy, and it&rsquo;s hard to find time to make games</li>
<li>The problem is you need to make a lot of games to build the skills necessary to make game development a lifelong career</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no way around this. The experience gets you to where you want to go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You make good work by (among other things) making lots of work that isn&rsquo;t very good, and gradually weeding out the parts that aren&rsquo;t good, the parts that aren&rsquo;t yours. It&rsquo;s called feedback, and it&rsquo;s the most direct route to learning about your own vision. It&rsquo;s also called doing your work. After all, someone has to do your work, and you&rsquo;re the closest person around.” - David Bayles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: The two-hour game jam is the best practice to develop and keep your skills sharp and growing. It will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help you develop your unique style and voice</li>
<li>Teach you how to wield your tools efficiently</li>
<li>Show you how to scope, finish, and ship</li>
<li>Force you to value process over outcome</li>
<li>And so much more&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this is new. People have been making games in a short time frame for a long time. Vlambeer, a successful independent game studio, was created by game jam culture. Jan Willem Nijman would regularly participate in 3-hour game jams. <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/fart-race/286">He even once made a game in 16 minutes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s when I realized that design experience isn’t in the size of your games, or even in the scope of it - it’s in the number of projects you’ve been through. - <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-a-week-getting-experienced-at-failure">Rami Ismail</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game developer who has made a hundred small games has a massive advantage over the designer who&rsquo;s only ever worked on one big game.</p>

<p><strong>The big benefit</strong>: This is a sustainable practice. Because the time commitment is so low, you can do this even if you have the busiest schedules. I&rsquo;ve maintained this practice even while caring for a newborn, helping launch a AAA game, and spooling up a new workout routine.</p>

<p><strong>No matter how busy life gets, I can still crank out a game in 2 hours.</strong></p>

<p>The best part is you don&rsquo;t need to do the 2 hours all at once! I tend to split up my 2-hour game jam into four 30-minute sessions.</p>

<p><strong>If you have 30 minutes every other day of the week, you can make games and improve your skills.</strong></p>

<p>By consistently practicing the 2-hour game jam, I&rsquo;ve been able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Break into the game industry</li>
<li>Learn a bunch of different game engines and techniques</li>
<li>Get thousands of people to play my games on itch.io</li>
<li>Create over 100 games</li>
<li>Design innovative features for large teams and game studios</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s just straight-up fun! If you commit to the practice, I guarantee you will have fun.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started-in-4-easy-steps">How to get started in 4 easy steps</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-make-a-game-a-week-for-one-month">Step 1. Make a game a week for one month</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every Monday, commit to creating a new game</li>
<li>Work on your game for 30 minutes every other day. Or all at once. The choice is yours.</li>
<li>Remember! You only get two hours!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-2-ship-it-or-kill-it">Step 2. Ship it or Kill it</h3>

<ul>
<li>When two hours are up, your game should be finished.</li>
<li>Decide whether to ship the game or delete it forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>This part is crucial! You&rsquo;ve made a game, and now it&rsquo;s time to put it in players’ hands so that they can play it. If you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to share your game, you must delete the game. Permanently.</p>

<p>This teaches you a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Games are meant to be played by other people</li>
<li>Delete your game so you&rsquo;re not tempted to &ldquo;delay&rdquo; or keep working on it</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get attached to your work</li>
</ul>

<p>However, go for it if you want to capture a screenshot or video before deleting your game.</p>

<p><strong>A common objection</strong>: &ldquo;But what if I want to keep working on it because I like what I built and it has potential?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took two hours to make the game. Delete it and start over. If you can&rsquo;t get yourself to do that, the game may not be worth pursuing.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-process-over-outcome">Step 3. Process over outcome</h3>

<p>The 2-hour game jam is a practice. You don&rsquo;t go to the gym once and suddenly become fit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about how the game turned out</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry if the game is good or bad</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about if you feel like it&rsquo;s a waste of time</li>
</ul>

<p>This practice will build on itself, given enough reps and time.</p>

<p>Repetition. Repetition. Repetition. This is how you get better. <strong>This is how you make games for a lifetime.</strong></p>

			 <p>It was probably not the best idea. I have a newborn, and I&rsquo;m helping the studio I work at launch its first game in the next couple of months&hellip; so time isn&rsquo;t something I have a lot of.</p>

<p><strong>Anyways</strong>: I decided to make a card game for the Godot Wild Jam. The theme is &ldquo;Train&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>I established the data structure for shuffling and dealing out the deck of cards</li>
<li>Picked the color palette for the game</li>
<li>Got a basic visual representation of cards to show up on the screen</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Concept</strong>: You&rsquo;re a personal trainer for trains.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your goal is to help them get fit by helping them shed their extra cargo</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll play cards and powerups to help them lose the right amount of cargo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Next up</strong>: I gotta work on the functionality for allowing the player to play cards.</p>

<li>&ldquo;<strong>If</strong>&rdquo; implies choices and possibility</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>You</strong>&rdquo; puts the player at the center of the design</li>
</ul>

<p>This method serves as a way to check how intuitive the concept is. If it&rsquo;s confusing as a sentence, it will be confusing as gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, but</strong>: Add a &ldquo;but&rdquo; at the end of the statement to introduce a twist to the concept. The Dark Souls example becomes, &ldquo;<strong>If you</strong> rest at a bonfire, <strong>then</strong> it unlocks a checkpoint&hellip; <strong>But</strong>, it also respawns all the enemies in the area.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Good game design starts with clear and easy-to-understand concepts.</p>

			 <p>🕹️ Game Design Tip: &ldquo;If the player doesn&rsquo;t see it, it may not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If you have something in your game that the player can&rsquo;t perceive, those areas may not benefit your design.</p>

			 <p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: In game design, not pushing a button can be just as important as pushing a button. Choosing not to do something should have gameplay consequences.</p>

<p><li>If there’s a benefit to doing something in your game, there should also be a benefit to not doing it.
This approach creates tradeoffs. Tradeoffs are one of a player&rsquo;s most fun decisions in a game.</li></p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>: Say you have a treasure chest in your game that the player can destroy to earn a reward; what are some ways to reward them for not destroying it?</p>

<p>Maybe they could:</p>

<p><li>Gift the chest to an NPC to increase friendship with them </li>
<li>Use the chest to climb onto a ledge that’s out of reach </li></p>

<p><strong>The bottom line</strong>: You can increase the depth of a single interaction if you consider how the player can benefit from not doing the interaction. 🕹️</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: &ldquo;But what does the player get to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the question I have to ask after most game announcements and trailers.</p>

<p><strong>The bottom line</strong>:
Cinematic trailers are not gameplay. Backstory and lore are not gameplay. Beautiful graphics are not gameplay.</p>

			 <p>The player sees a sign, they provide input, and then receive feedback. Repeat. This loop is the heart of how games create a dialogue with the player.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Sending clear messages and feedback about the state of the game allows the player to react and make informed choices. This is a critical element to making a game more enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>The bigger picture</strong>: Creating gameplay that provides clear signs and feedback is more than just crafting a more fun experience. It&rsquo;s about making a more accessible experience so that more people can enjoy games.</p>
