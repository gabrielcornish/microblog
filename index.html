			 <p>Unemployed as a game developer? Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m staying on track and keeping my spirits up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve crafted a simple daily routine that&rsquo;s been essential for my mental well-being and productivity during this period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning: Create 🎨</li>
<li>Midday: Connect 📨</li>
<li>Afternoon: Contribute 🙌🏽</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create</strong>: This is all about building skills and creative growth. While the timing of my next opportunity is uncertain, I&rsquo;m making the most of this time by exploring new technologies, building games, and honing my craft.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong>: This phase is all about maximizing opportunities. Whether it&rsquo;s reaching out to my network, applying for roles, or sharing my latest work, I&rsquo;m just trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p><strong>Contribute</strong>: Giving back to the community is key. Whether it&rsquo;s helping others in their job search, collaborating on indie projects, or participating in game jams, assisting others is how we&rsquo;re all going to get through this.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one last bonus&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Evenings: Community</li>
</ul>
<p>Evenings are dedicated to recharging with loved ones. It&rsquo;s my time to unplug, rest, and cherish moments with friends and family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear what strategies have been working for you as you navigate your job search. Drop a comment below and let&rsquo;s support each other!</p>
<p>Cheers and happy Friday everyone!</p>

<p>If you feel burnt out or disillusioned, think about treating yourself to a small game project that&rsquo;s just for you.</p>

<li>🗓️ Make it in a month.</li>
<li>⏱️ Work on it for 1-2 hours a week.</li>
<li>🔥 Don&rsquo;t crunch. Cut scope instead.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I wanted to contribute something to the <a href="https://internet-janitor.itch.io/decker/community">Decker</a> community&hellip; because they&rsquo;re awesome!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my game idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survive being trapped in your own video game while finding a way out.</li>
<li>The game will be a Choose Your Own Adventure style game with some random elements and resource management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="start-with-art">Start With Art</h2>
<p>One of my weakest areas of game development is art, so that&rsquo;s where I wanted to focus my attention for this jam.</p>
<p>I want to focus on developing my own style over the course of the jam. That means making a lot of art and also throwing away a lot of art.</p>
<p>You can see some of the exploration I&rsquo;ve done already.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To keep myself accountable, I also want to produce frequent dev logs as the jam progresses.</p>
<p>I hope that showing my process will encourage others to also make their own games.</p>
<p>If you want to receive updates on how I&rsquo;m developing the game, you can follow along by subscribing to my <a href="https://gabrielcornish.com/subscribe/">newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>With Paradox Tectonic&rsquo;s closure, I&rsquo;ve begun exploring new opportunities. But, I haven&rsquo;t been alone in this journey.</p>
<p>In the past week, the outpouring of support from fellow game developers has been overwhelming. I&rsquo;ve received job leads, encouragement, and invaluable connections.</p>
<p>This support has made all the difference.</p>
<p>The industry&rsquo;s current state has only strengthened the bonds among us game developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m committed to paying it forward. If there&rsquo;s any way I can contribute or support you in your game dev journey, please let me know.</p>

			 <p>Today I found out the studio I work at is shutting down and that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of studio closures and layoffs in the game industry. It can feel like we&rsquo;re yet another headline in a sea of headlines.</p>
<p>So, while the attention is on the Tectonic studio, I wanted to say my piece.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<p>🙏 TO THE TEAM</p>
<p>Thank you to all the teammates I worked with in the trenches at Tectonic. Thank you for teaching me patience and resilience.</p>
<p>Thank you for sending flowers when a loved one passed and celebrating with me for the birth of my child. It meant the world to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for teaching me hard things. Thank you for fixing my messy scripts. Thank you for giving me feedback and critiques.</p>
<p>Thank you for showing me better ways to do things.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting my ideas and allowing me to collaborate on yours.</p>
<p>Thank you for continuing to work on the game, even on this day.</p>
<p>🙌 TO THE PLAYERS</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting Life By You.</p>
<p>Thank you for your direct and honest feedback. It changed the game for the better, when our voices alone couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your input. It helped us advocate for the changes we believed in.</p>
<p>Thank you for welcoming us into the Life Simulation community with open arms. What a beautiful and diverse group of fans.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us the chance to build this game for you. I hope that one day you will get to experience it for yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you need great talent to join your game studio, look no further than the fine folk at Paradox Tectonic.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

			 <p>I wanted to work on my game.  Actually, no&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I NEEDED to work on my game</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Month had gone by and I had made close to zero progress.</p>
<p>There was a month left of development and I was no where near releasing something onto my itch.io page.</p>
<p>If I could just sit down for a little bit and work on my game, I could make progress. And, if I could make a little progress I could feel excited about working on my game again.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could build some momentum.</li>
<li>And If I could build some momentum, there may be a chance I would release my game in time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But, I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</strong></p>
<p>I even negotiated with myself. 30 minutes is all it would take.</p>
<p>I told myself, &ldquo;Work on the game for 30 minutes and the rest would take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>But, I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to do it. Why?</strong></p>
<p>The problem is that I had built this game up in my mind to the point that it was intimidating.</p>
<p>My vision was so far ahead of my execution, that I became paralyzed. I believed that no matter what I did next, it would fall short of my expectations.</p>
<p><strong>And the truth is, I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</strong></p>
<p>I was going to sit down and work on my game and it was not going to turn out the way it was in my head.</p>
<p><strong>It was going to be imperfect</strong>. No two ways around it.</p>
<p>And there was the obstacle. Looking me right in the face.</p>
<p><strong>I was being a perfectionist.</strong></p>
<p>And so long as I was going to be a perfectionist, this game wasn&rsquo;t going to get made. Period.</p>
<p>I had to accept that it was going to be imperfect, no matter what I did.</p>
<p>But, how do you stop being a perfectionist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some switch you can turn off. Especially if you&rsquo;re the type of person who needs to feel like things are in control. Ha! Good luck.</p>
<p>I needed to get through this inner obstacle if I was going to sit down and work on my game for 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>So, I made a plan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My plan was</strong>: If I procrastinated because of perfectionism, I would tell myself &ldquo;imperfections are my unique style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan made a huge difference.</p>
<p>It reminded me that embracing imperfections is what makes something unique.</p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m happy to say I got myself to work on my game for 30 minutes. And I&rsquo;ve used this tactic to help me do it again.</p>
<p>It seems like a small win, but I hope you can find the time to work on your game for 30 minutes.</p>

			 <p>It was probably not the best idea. I have a newborn, and I&rsquo;m helping the studio I work at launch its first game in the next couple of months&hellip; so time isn&rsquo;t something I have a lot of.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways</strong>: I decided to make a card game for the Godot Wild Jam. The theme is &ldquo;Train&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I established the data structure for shuffling and dealing out the deck of cards</li>
<li>Picked the color palette for the game</li>
<li>Got a basic visual representation of cards to show up on the screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Concept</strong>: You&rsquo;re a personal trainer for trains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your goal is to help them get fit by helping them shed their extra cargo</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll play cards and powerups to help them lose the right amount of cargo</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next up</strong>: I gotta work on the functionality for allowing the player to play cards.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Gameplay becomes stronger when you talk about it the same way players talk about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>If you</strong> drink the potion, <strong>then</strong> you heal&rdquo; (Every game ever)</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>If you</strong> rest at a bonfire, <strong>then</strong> it unlocks a checkpoint&rdquo; (Dark Souls)</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>If you</strong> throw your axe, <strong>then</strong> you can press triangle to recall it&rdquo; (God of War)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: &ldquo;If You&rdquo; is one of the best ways to start a gameplay concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>If</strong>&rdquo; implies choices and possibility</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>You</strong>&rdquo; puts the player at the center of the design</li>
</ul>
<p>This method serves as a way to check how intuitive the concept is. If it&rsquo;s confusing as a sentence, it will be confusing as gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but</strong>: Add a &ldquo;but&rdquo; at the end of the statement to introduce a twist to the concept. The Dark Souls example becomes, &ldquo;<strong>If you</strong> rest at a bonfire, <strong>then</strong> it unlocks a checkpoint&hellip; <strong>But</strong>, it also respawns all the enemies in the area.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Good game design starts with clear and easy-to-understand concepts.</p>
