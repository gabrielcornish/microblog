			 <p>My toddler‚Äôs activity of choice this morning was to randomly throw my shoes around the house‚Ä¶ and after seeing how much fun he was having, I joined in.</p>
<p>The kid makes a good point. Throwing shoes is fun as hell.</p>

			 <p>As I become another game developer affected by layoffs, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m terrified of what&rsquo;s next and what I want from a career in games.</p>
<p>The scariest thing is admitting to yourself what you actually want. Especially when it runs counter to everything you&rsquo;ve told yourself and believed.</p>

			 <p>Panic time!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming up on the remaining days of the jam and I still have nothing as far as gameplay. I&rsquo;ve tried out a few things, but nothing seems to be sticking.</p>
<p>I need to pivot to something and fast. It seems like the best possible strategy I can do is SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY.</p>

			 <p>Game design is great because you can make the tiniest victories feel major with enough positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>Games can help people feel joy from their smallest actions and I just love that.</p>

			 <p>A great way to procrastinate working on your game is to work on the title screen instead. Here&rsquo;s my first stab at the cover art for Hell Dev.</p>

			 <p>üïπÔ∏è Today, was more art exploration for the game jam.</p>
<p>I also set up the two main resources.</p>
<p>The player will be managing Health and Glitches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health is simple. If it reaches zero: game over.</li>
<li>Glitches are meant to be collected. Collect enough glitches to escape the video game you&rsquo;re trapped inside.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I just dropped everything to join the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/decker-fantasy-camp-2024">Decker Fantasy Camp 2024</a> and I have 22 days to finish a game.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I wanted to contribute something to the <a href="https://internet-janitor.itch.io/decker/community">Decker</a> community&hellip; because they&rsquo;re awesome!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my game idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survive being trapped in your own video game while finding a way out.</li>
<li>The game will be a Choose Your Own Adventure style game with some random elements and resource management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="start-with-art">Start With Art</h2>
<p>One of my weakest areas of game development is art, so that&rsquo;s where I wanted to focus my attention for this jam.</p>
<p>I want to focus on developing my own style over the course of the jam. That means making a lot of art and also throwing away a lot of art.</p>
<p>You can see some of the exploration I&rsquo;ve done already.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To keep myself accountable, I also want to produce frequent dev logs as the jam progresses.</p>
<p>I hope that showing my process will encourage others to also make their own games.</p>
<p>If you want to receive updates on how I&rsquo;m developing the game, you can follow along by subscribing to my <a href="https://gabrielcornish.com/subscribe/">newsletter</a>.</p>

			 <p>üôåüèΩ I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the game development community.</p>
<p>With Paradox Tectonic&rsquo;s closure, I&rsquo;ve begun exploring new opportunities. But, I haven&rsquo;t been alone in this journey.</p>
<p>In the past week, the outpouring of support from fellow game developers has been overwhelming. I&rsquo;ve received job leads, encouragement, and invaluable connections.</p>
<p>This support has made all the difference.</p>
<p>The industry&rsquo;s current state has only strengthened the bonds among us game developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m committed to paying it forward. If there&rsquo;s any way I can contribute or support you in your game dev journey, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

			 <p>Today I found out the studio I work at is shutting down and that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of studio closures and layoffs in the game industry. It can feel like we&rsquo;re yet another headline in a sea of headlines.</p>
<p>So, while the attention is on the Tectonic studio, I wanted to say my piece.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<p>üôè TO THE TEAM</p>
<p>Thank you to all the teammates I worked with in the trenches at Tectonic. Thank you for teaching me patience and resilience.</p>
<p>Thank you for sending flowers when a loved one passed and celebrating with me for the birth of my child. It meant the world to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for teaching me hard things. Thank you for fixing my messy scripts. Thank you for giving me feedback and critiques.</p>
<p>Thank you for showing me better ways to do things.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting my ideas and allowing me to collaborate on yours.</p>
<p>Thank you for continuing to work on the game, even on this day.</p>
<p>üôå TO THE PLAYERS</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting Life By You.</p>
<p>Thank you for your direct and honest feedback. It changed the game for the better, when our voices alone couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your input. It helped us advocate for the changes we believed in.</p>
<p>Thank you for welcoming us into the Life Simulation community with open arms. What a beautiful and diverse group of fans.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us the chance to build this game for you. I hope that one day you will get to experience it for yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you need great talent to join your game studio, look no further than the fine folk at Paradox Tectonic.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
