Thank you for teaching me patience and resilience. \r\n\r\nThank you for sending flowers when a loved one passed and celebrating with me for the birth of my child. It meant the world to me.\r\n\r\nThank you for teaching me hard things. Thank you for fixing my messy scripts. Thank you for giving me feedback and critiques.\r\n\r\nThank you for showing me better ways to do things.\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting my ideas and allowing me to collaborate on yours.\r\n\r\nThank you for continuing to work on the game, even on this day.\r\n\r\nüôå TO THE PLAYERS\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting Life By You.\r\n\r\nThank you for your direct and honest feedback. It changed the game for the better, when our voices alone couldn't. \r\n\r\nThank you for all of your input. It helped us advocate for the changes we believed in.\r\n\r\nThank you for welcoming us into the Life Simulation community with open arms. What a beautiful and diverse group of fans.\r\n\r\nThank you for giving us the chance to build this game for you.
