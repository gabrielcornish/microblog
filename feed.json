The value you get from a good feedback process outweighs any of the costs.\n\nIt's never too early to get feedback. \n\nLook at how Slay the Spire looked when their designers started requesting feedback. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/slay.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n\nThat game went on to become a smash hit!\n\n## My Story with Feedback\n\nI didn't always take feedback well. \n\nIn the beginning, I would get defensive or justify my design. I would blame the person for not \"getting\" my design.\n\nThis held me back as a game designer.\n\n But when I started embracing feedback, everything changed. I went from a so-so designer to one of the best on my team! I got promotions and more opportunities within the studio.\n\nPeople enjoyed working with me because I was open to their ideas. They felt comfortable coming to me with problems and I loved hearing their feedback. \n\nIt wasn't always easy, but it was always worth it.\n\n## Feedback Made Easy: A Two-Step Process\n\nReady to become a feedback expert? Here's how:\n\n1. **Appreciate the Feedback**: Say thanks, even if you don't agree. It shows gratitude and encourages the other person to come back with more.\n\n2. **Accept or Discard**: You decide if the feedback works for your game. Give the feedback honest consideration before making a decision. (Pssst, you can keep this part a secret.)\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nFeedback isn't just about making your game better. It's about being a better designer, a better team player, and building trust with players. \n\nWhen someone offers you feedback, remember, it's not just advice.  It's your ticket to being a great game designer! üåüüéÆüëæ\n",
